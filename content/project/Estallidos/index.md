ESTALLIDOS is a coordinated project between several Spanish research centers to study the formation and evolution of outbursts of star formation.

The project is aimed at studying massive starbursts and their impact on galaxies, using both observational and theoretical tools. We observe starbursts and model the physical processes that are involved, paying particular attention to the feedback on the surroundings that quenches or stimulates the formation of successive generations of stars.

The project began in December 2001, in a collaboration among astronomers from the LAEFF (Madrid; currently integrated into the CAB ), the VILSPA (Madrid, currently ESAC ), the IAA (Granada), and the IAC (Canary Islands) funded by the Spanish Plan Nacional de Astronomía y Astrofísica ( AYA2001-3939-C03 ). From the beginning, the project has involved the participation of researchers from all over the world. In later editions, UAM , and, posteriorly CIEMAT (Madrid) joined the project. Details about the different funded projects can be found in the Organization Chart and Operations item in the left menu.

Now we are in the eighth edition:  ESTALLIDOS 8 : Las diversas facetas de la formación estelar en el Universo (PID2022-136598NB-C31, C32 and C33) which is coordinated by the IAC  node.

The project is organized and coordinated through  workshops in which ongoing work is discussed and new results are presented. They are attended by a significant part of the Estallidos community ( currently around 60 ) and help to maintain strong scientific bounds and close collaborations.
