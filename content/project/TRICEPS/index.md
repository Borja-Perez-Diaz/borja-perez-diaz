TRICEPS is a survey of 15 massive galaxies at z=4-5, when the Universe was less than 1.5 Gyr old. TRICEPS combines new observations from ALMA, JWST, and the VLA, as well as ancillary data from HST, Spitzer, and Herschell. 

The main goal is of TRICEPS is to trace the distribution of baryons and dark matter in the most distant rotation-supported galaxies, using ALMA [CII] data to trace the rotation curve, JWST NIR data to trace the stellar mass, and VLA CO(1-0) data to trace the gas mass.

The P.I: of the project is Prof. Federico Lelli.
