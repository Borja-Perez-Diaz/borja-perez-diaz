abstract: Future and ongoing infrared (IR) and radio observatories such as JWST, METIS,
  and ALMA are increasing the amount of rest-frame IR spectroscopic data for galaxies
  by several orders of magnitude. The studies of the chemical composition of the interstellar
  medium (ISM) can be hugely improved exploiting the data obtained in these spectral
  ranges. Among the advantages of the IR regime, it is less affected by temperature
  and dust extinction, traces higher ionic species, and can also provide robust estimations
  of the chemical abundance ratio N/O. For instance, in (Ultra)-Luminous Infrared
  Galaxies ([U]LIRGs), the IR regime peers through their dusty medium and allows us
  to include the obscured metals in their studies. In this contribution, we describe
  how to take advantage of the bayesian-like code HII- CHI-Mistry-IR to analyze the
  chemical content in a sample of ULIRGs, reviewing our findings from the study of
  their IR emission, comparing them to the results from optical data, and ending up
  by describing the finding of deviations in a sub- sample of the analyzed ULIRGs
  from their expected mass- metallicity relation (MZR). We interpret this result as
  a consequence of the action of massive inflows of metal poor gas that produces that
  some galaxies experience a ``deep-diving'' phase in the MZR diagram, as the metals
  from their ISM are diluted.
