 abstract = {We estimate chemical abundances and ionization parameters in the nuclear
region of a sample of 143 galaxies from the Palomar
Spectroscopic Survey, composed by star-forming galaxies (87),
Seyferts 2 (16), and LINERs (40) using the HII-CHI-MISTRY code.
We also study for each spectral type the correlation of the
derived quantities with other different properties of the host
galaxies, such as morphology, stellar mass, luminosity, and mass
of their supermassive black holes. The results obtained for
star-forming galaxies are used to check the soundness of our
methodology. Then, we replicate a similar study for our sample
of AGN, distinguishing between Seyferts 2 and LINERs. We report
a saturation of Oxygen abundances for the nuclear regions of
SFG. The correlations between chemical abundances and their host
galaxy properties for SFG are in good agreement with previous
studies. We find that Seyferts 2 present slightly higher
chemical abundances but this result must be reexamined in larger
samples of Seyfert galaxies. In contrast, we obtain lower
chemical abundances for LINERs than for SFG. We confirm these
relatively lower abundances for another sample of infrared
luminous LINERs in the same stellar mass range. Our analysis of
AGNs (both LINERs and Seyferts) shows that their host galaxy
properties are not correlated with our estimated chemical
abundances.},
