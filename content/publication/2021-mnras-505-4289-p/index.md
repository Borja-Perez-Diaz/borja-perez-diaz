abstract: We estimate chemical abundances and ionization parameters in the nuclear
  region of a sample of 143 galaxies from the Palomar Spectroscopic Survey, composed
  by star-forming galaxies (87), Seyferts 2 (16), and LINERs (40) using the HII-CHI-MISTRY
  code. We also study for each spectral type the correlation of the derived quantities
  with other different properties of the host galaxies, such as morphology, stellar
  mass, luminosity, and mass of their supermassive black holes. The results obtained
  for star-forming galaxies are used to check the soundness of our methodology. Then,
  we replicate a similar study for our sample of AGN, distinguishing between Seyferts
  2 and LINERs. We report a saturation of Oxygen abundances for the nuclear regions
  of SFG. The correlations between chemical abundances and their host galaxy properties
  for SFG are in good agreement with previous studies. We find that Seyferts 2 present
  slightly higher chemical abundances but this result must be reexamined in larger
  samples of Seyfert galaxies. In contrast, we obtain lower chemical abundances for
  LINERs than for SFG. We confirm these relatively lower abundances for another sample
  of infrared luminous LINERs in the same stellar mass range. Our analysis of AGNs
  (both LINERs and Seyferts) shows that their host galaxy properties are not correlated
  with our estimated chemical abundances.
