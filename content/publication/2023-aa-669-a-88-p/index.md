abstract: ' Aims: We explore the so-called softness diagram - whose main function
  is to provide the hardness of the ionizing radiation in star-forming regions - in
  order to check whether hot and old low-mass evolved stars (HOLMES) are significant
  contributors to the ionization within star-forming regions, as suggested by previous
  MaNGA data analyses.  Methods: We used the code HCM-TEFF to derive both the ionization
  parameter and the equivalent effective temperature (T$_*$), adopting models of massive
  stars and planetary nebulae (PNe), and exploring different sets of emission lines
  in the softness diagram to figure out the main causes of the observed differences
  in the softness parameter in the MaNGA and CHAOS star-forming region samples.  Results:
  We find that the fraction of regions with a resulting T$_*$ > 60 kK, which are supposedly
  ionised by sources harder than massive stars, is considerably larger in the MaNGA
  (66%) than in the CHAOS (20%) sample when the [S II] ensuremathłambdaensuremathłambda
  6716,6731 ̊A emission lines are used in the softness diagram. However, the respective
  fractions of regions in this regime for both samples are considerably reduced (20%
  in MaNGA and 10% in CHAOS) when the [N II] emission line at ensuremathłambda 6584
  Å is used instead. This may indicate that diffuse ionised gas (DIG) contamination
  in the lower resolution MaNGA data is responsible for artificially increasing the
  measured T$_*$ as opposed to there being a predominant role of HOLMES in the H II
  regions.'
