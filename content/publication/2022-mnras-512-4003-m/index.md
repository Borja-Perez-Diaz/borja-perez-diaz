abstract: The central star of the planetary nebula (PN) HuBi 1 has been recently proposed
  to have experienced a very late thermal pulse (VLTP), but the dilution of the emission
  of the recent ejecta by that of the surrounding H-rich old outer shell has so far
  hindered confirming its suspected H-poor nature. We present here an analysis of
  the optical properties of the ejecta in the innermost regions of HuBi 1 using MEGARA
  high-dispersion integral field and OSIRIS intermediate-dispersion long-slit spectroscopic
  observations obtained with the 10.4-m Gran Telescopio de Canarias. The unprecedented
  tomographic capability of MEGARA to resolve structures in velocity space allowed
  us to disentangle for the first time the Hensuremathα and Hensuremathβ emission
  of the recent ejecta from that of the outer shell. The recent ejecta is found to
  have much higher extinction than the outer shell, implying the presence of large
  amounts of dust. The spatial distribution of the emission from the ejecta and the
  locus of key line ratios in diagnostic diagrams probe the shock excitation of the
  inner ejecta in HuBi 1, in stark contrast with the photoionization nature of the
  H-rich outer shell. The abundances of the recent ejecta have been computed using
  the MAPPINGS V code under a shock scenario. They are found to be consistent with
  a born-again ejection scenario experienced by the progenitor star, which is thus
  firmly confirmed as a new 'born-again' star.
