abstract: 'We present a new method to derive heavy element abundances in star forming
  galaxies using the unique suite of nebular lines in the mid- to far-infrared (IR)
  range. Using grids of photo-ionisation models that cover a wide range in O/H and
  N/O, and ionisation parameter, HII-CHI-MISTRY-IR (HCm-IR) provides abundances based
  on extinction-free and temperature-insensitive tracers, two significant advantages
  over optical diagnostics when these are applied to dust obscured regions or unresolved
  (stratified) nebulae. The code performance is probed using three different galaxy
  samples covering a wide range in metallicity, 7.2 < 12 + log(O/H) < 8.9, with available
  IR spectroscopy from Spitzer, Herschel and SOFIA, including: 28 low-metallicity
  dwarf galaxies, 19 nearby starbursts, and 9 luminous IR galaxies. The IR-based abundances
  are robust even when the hydrogen recombination lines, typically faint in this range,
  are not available. When compared to various optical-based methods, HCm- IR is consistent
  within an average difference of 0.1 dex and a scatter of 0.2 dex. Additionally,
  HCm-IR provides an independent N/O measurement when [OIII]52,88textmum and [NIII]57textmum
  are measured, probing the secondary production of nitrogen. We find systematically
  lower N/O IR abundances when compared to the optical determinations, suggesting
  that IR lines may trace higher excitation gas located closer to massive stars. Finally,
  we applied the code to a sample of 8 distant galaxies located at 1.8 < z < 7.5 with
  ground-based detections of the far-IR lines redshifted in the submm range, revealing
  sub-solar N/O and O/H abundances. The script to derive chemical abundances with
  HCm-IR is publicly available.'
