 abstract = {A large, faint nebula was unexpectedly discovered near M31 using
narrowband [O III] images. Its apparent size and the lack of a
clear counterpart at other wavelengths make it unique and
challenging to explain. We aim to determine whether the nebula
is extragalactic or located within the Milky Way. This will
enable us to constrain its physical properties and assess its
nature. To do so, we obtained deep narrowband [O II]3727 and
H$α$+[NII] observations with the JAST80 telescope at the
Observatorio Astrofı́sico de Javalambre, as well as high-
spectral-resolution spectroscopy at four locations within the
region of interest using MEGARA at the Gran Telescopio Canarias.
We found extended [O II] emission along two near-parallel
strands to the [O III], offset by six arcmin. The nebular
spectra reveals up to 6 emission lines from [O III]4959,5007,
H$β$, [N II]6583, and [S II]6716,6731. Their receding
velocities are above $-$40 km s$^-1$, far from the systemic
velocity of M31 ($-$300 km s$^-1$). The fluxes and velocities
are consistent for the same lines across different regions of
the nebula. The nebular properties suggest a location within the
Milky Way rather than being physically associated with M31. The
most likely scenario is a resolved ionization structure in a
Galactic nebula with a separation between [O II] and [O III] of
a few parsecs. The observed receding velocities would be
unprecedented for an object physically linked to M31 but are
common for nearby gas filaments. Their consistency across the
nebula would also be unusual if it were larger than a
kiloparsec. The analysis of the emission-line ratios, line
widths, and morphology suggests the possibility of it being an
interstellar gas filament with an additional source of
ionization to explain the [O III] emission. However, the complex
properties of this object call for further observations to
confirm its nature.},
