abstract: Context. The chemical enrichment in low-ionization nuclear emission-line
  regions (LINERs) is still an issue with spatial resolution spectroscopic data because
  we lack studies and because the nature of their ionizing source is uncertain, although
  they are the most abundant type of active galaxies in the nearby Universe. Aims.
  Considering different scenarios for the ionizing source (hot old stellar populations,
  active galactic nuclei, or inefficient accretion disks), we analyze the implications
  of these assumptions to constrain the chemical content of the gas- phase interstellar
  medium. Methods. We used a sample of 105 galaxies from the survey called Mapping
  Nearby Galaxies at Apache Point Observatory (MaNGA), whose nuclear central spaxels
  show LINER-like emission. For each scenario we considered, we built a grid of photoionization
  models (4928 models for each considered ionizing source) that were later used in
  the open- source code HII-CHI-MISTRY. This allowed us to estimate chemical abundance
  ratios such as 12+log(O/H) or log(N/O) and to constrain the ionization parameters
  that characterize the ionized interstellar medium in these galaxies. Results. The
  oxygen abundances in the nuclear region of LINER-like galaxies are spread over a
  wide range 8.08 < 12+log(O/H) < 8.89, with a median solar value (in agreement with
  previous studies) when models for active galactic nuclei are considered. Nevertheless,
  the nitrogen-to-oxygen ratio we derived is much less affected by the assumptions
  on the ionizing source and indicates suprasolar values (log(N/O) = ‑0.69). By comparing
  the different scenarios, we show that if hot old stellar populations caused the
  ionization of the interstellar medium, a complex picture (e.g., outflows and/or
  inflows that scale with the galaxy chemical abundance) would be needed to explain
  the chemical enrichment history, whereas the assumption of active galactic nucleus
  activity is compatible with the standard scenario that is found in most galaxies.
