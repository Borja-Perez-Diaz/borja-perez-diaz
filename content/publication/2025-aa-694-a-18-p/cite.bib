 abstract = {Context. The chemical enrichment in low-ionization nuclear emission-line
regions (LINERs) is still an issue with spatial resolution
spectroscopic data because we lack studies and because the
nature of their ionizing source is uncertain, although they are
the most abundant type of active galaxies in the nearby
Universe. Aims. Considering different scenarios for the ionizing
source (hot old stellar populations, active galactic nuclei, or
inefficient accretion disks), we analyze the implications of
these assumptions to constrain the chemical content of the gas-
phase interstellar medium. Methods. We used a sample of 105
galaxies from the survey called Mapping Nearby Galaxies at
Apache Point Observatory (MaNGA), whose nuclear central spaxels
show LINER-like emission. For each scenario we considered, we
built a grid of photoionization models (4928 models for each
considered ionizing source) that were later used in the open-
source code HII-CHI-MISTRY. This allowed us to estimate chemical
abundance ratios such as 12+log(O/H) or log(N/O) and to
constrain the ionization parameters that characterize the
ionized interstellar medium in these galaxies. Results. The
oxygen abundances in the nuclear region of LINER-like galaxies
are spread over a wide range 8.08 < 12+log(O/H) < 8.89, with a
median solar value (in agreement with previous studies) when
models for active galactic nuclei are considered. Nevertheless,
the nitrogen-to-oxygen ratio we derived is much less affected by
the assumptions on the ionizing source and indicates suprasolar
values (log(N/O) = ‑0.69). By comparing the different scenarios,
we show that if hot old stellar populations caused the
ionization of the interstellar medium, a complex picture (e.g.,
outflows and/or inflows that scale with the galaxy chemical
abundance) would be needed to explain the chemical enrichment
history, whereas the assumption of active galactic nucleus
activity is compatible with the standard scenario that is found
in most galaxies.},
