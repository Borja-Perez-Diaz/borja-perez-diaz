abstract: Heavy element accumulation and stellar mass assembly are fundamental processes
  in the formation and evolution of galaxies. However, the key elements that govern
  them, such as gas accretion and outflow, are not fully understood. This is especially
  true for luminous and massive galaxies, which usually suffer strong feedback as
  massive outflows and large-scale gas accretion triggered by galaxy interactions.
  Using a sample of 77 luminous infrared (IR) galaxies, we derive chemical abundances
  using new diagnostics based on nebular IR lines, which peer through their dusty
  medium and allow us to include the obscured metals. In contrast to optically based
  studies, our analysis reveals that most luminous IR galaxies remain close to the
  mass-metallicity relation. Four galaxies with extreme star formation rates (>60
  M$_ensuremathødot$ yr$^ensuremath-1$) in their late-merger stages show strongly
  depressed metallicities (12 + log(O/H) ensuremath≈ 7.7-8.1) along with solar-like
  N/O ratios, indicative of gas mixing processes and suggesting the action of massive
  infall of metal-poor gas in a short phase, eventually followed by rapid enrichment.
  These results challenge the classical gas equilibrium scenario applied to main-sequence
  galaxies, suggesting that chemical enrichment and stellar-mass growth in luminous
  IR galaxies likely occur via mergers, driving these galaxies out of chemical equilibrium.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: Mergen-driven infall of metal-poor gas causes metallicity dillutation but enhances star formation, explaining observed properties of (U)LIRGs.
