abstract: 'We present new and archival SOFIA FIFI-LS far-IR spectroscopic observations
  of the [O III] 52 ensuremathμm and/or the [N III] 57 ensuremathμm lines of 25 local
  galaxies. Including 31 other galaxies from Herschel-PACS, we discuss a local sample
  of 47 galaxies, including the H II galaxies, luminous IR galaxies, low-metallicity
  dwarfs, and Seyfert nuclei. Analyzing the mid- to far-IR fine-structure lines of
  this sample, we assess the metallicity and compare it with the optical spectroscopy
  estimates. Using the IR, we find an O/H-N/O relation similar to that known in the
  optical. Conversely, we find systematically lower N/O IR abundances when compared
  to the optical determinations, especially at high values of N/O ( ?tex tbackslashmathrmlog(m̊N/textbacksla
  shrmO) $ -0.8). We explore various hypotheses to account for this difference: (i)
  difference in ionization structure traced by optical (O<SUP>+</SUP>, N<SUP>+</SUP>
  regions) versus IR lines (O<SUP>2+</SUP>, N<SUP>2+</SUP> regions), (ii) contamination
  of diffuse ionized gas affecting the optical lines used to compute the N/O abundance,
  and (iii) dust obscuration affecting the optical-based determinations. However,
  we have not found any correlation of ?̊Δ (rN̊/rm̊)=( rm̊/rmO)̊_mathrmOPT-(rmN̊rmO_̊mathrm
  IR$ with ionization, or electron density, or optical extinction. We speculatively
  suggest that the accretion of metal-poor gas from the circumgalactic medium could
  provide an explanation for this difference because the rapid decrease of total abundances
  during infall is followed by a N/O ratio decrease due to the primary production
  of young-possibly embedded-massive stars, which are preferentially traced by the
  IR diagnostics, while optical diagnostics would better trace the secondary production,
  when both N/O and O/H abundance ratios increase.'
