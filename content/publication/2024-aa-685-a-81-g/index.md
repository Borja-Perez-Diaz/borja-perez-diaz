abstract: 'Context. Recent work presented increasing evidence of high non-constant
  S/O abundance ratios observed in star-forming metal-poor galaxies that deviated
  from the constant canonical S/O across a wide range of O/H abundances. Similar peculiarly
  high Fe/O ratios have also recently been detected.  Aims: We investigate whether
  these high S/O ratios at low metallicities could be explained when the process of
  pair-instability supernovae (PISN) in chemical modelling is included, through which
  a similar behaviour of the Fe/O ratios was reproduced successfully.  Methods: We
  used chemical evolution models that considered the stages of PISN in the previously
  published yields and adopted a suitable initial mass function (IMF) to characterize
  this evolutionary stage appropriately.  Results: The peculiarly high values and
  the behaviour of the observed S/O versus O/H relation can be reproduced when the
  ejecta of very massive stars that go through the process of PISN are taken into
  account. Additionally, a bimodal top-heavy IMF and an initial strong burst of star
  formation are required to reach the reported high S/O values.  Conclusions: We show
  that the role of very massive stars going through the process of PISN should be
  taken into account to explain the chemical enrichment of sulphur and oxygen in metal-poor
  star-forming regions.'
