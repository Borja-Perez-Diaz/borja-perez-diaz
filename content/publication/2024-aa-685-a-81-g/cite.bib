 abstract = {Context. Recent work presented increasing evidence of high non-constant
S/O abundance ratios observed in star-forming metal-poor
galaxies that deviated from the constant canonical S/O across a
wide range of O/H abundances. Similar peculiarly high Fe/O
ratios have also recently been detected. \ Aims: We
investigate whether these high S/O ratios at low metallicities
could be explained when the process of pair-instability
supernovae (PISN) in chemical modelling is included, through
which a similar behaviour of the Fe/O ratios was reproduced
successfully. \ Methods: We used chemical evolution
models that considered the stages of PISN in the previously
published yields and adopted a suitable initial mass function
(IMF) to characterize this evolutionary stage appropriately.
\ Results: The peculiarly high values and the
behaviour of the observed S/O versus O/H relation can be
reproduced when the ejecta of very massive stars that go through
the process of PISN are taken into account. Additionally, a
bimodal top-heavy IMF and an initial strong burst of star
formation are required to reach the reported high S/O values.
\ Conclusions: We show that the role of very
massive stars going through the process of PISN should be taken
into account to explain the chemical enrichment of sulphur and
oxygen in metal-poor star-forming regions.},
