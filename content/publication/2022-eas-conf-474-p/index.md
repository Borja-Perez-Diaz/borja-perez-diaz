abstract: Future and on-going infrared and radio observatories such as JWST, METIS
  or ALMA will increase the amount of rest-frame IR spectroscopic data for galaxies
  by several orders of magnitude. While studies of the chemical composition of the
  ISM based on optical observations have been widely spread over decades for SFG and,
  more recently, for AGN, similar studies need to be perform using IR data which are
  less affected by temperature and dust extinction, trace high ionic species and provide
  robust estimations of the chemical abundance ratio N/O. We present a new tool based
  on a bayesian-like methodology (HII-CHI-Mistry-IR) to estimate chemical abundances
  from IR emission lines in AGN. We use a sample of 58 AGN with IR spectroscopic data
  retrieved from the literature to probe the validity of our method. IR estimations
  of chemical abundances in our sample composed by 43 Seyferts, 8 ULIRGs, 4 LIRGs
  and 3 LINERs are compared with those derived from optical emission lines. HII-CHI-Mistry-IR
  takes advantage of photoionization models to match a set of input emission lines
  with the best model characterized by the chemical abundance ratios O/H and N/O and
  the ionization parameter U. Instead of matching single emission lines, the code
  calculates sensitive ratios to the above free parameters. We report solar and subsolar
  abundances for O/H in the nuclear region for our sample of AGN, whereas N/O clusters
  around solar values. Compared to their optical estimations, there is a systematic
  discrepancy between IR and optical estimations of chemical abundances, being the
  later higher than the former. This result, consistent with previous studies of the
  composition of the ISM from IR observations, is independent from the density or
  the incident radiation field to the ISM.
