abstract: ' Aims: We explored the softness parameter in the infrared, ensuremathη$_IR$$^′$,
  whose main purpose is the characterisation of the hardness of the incident ionising
  radiation in emission-line nebulae. This parameter is obtained from the combination
  of mid-infrared wavelength range transitions corresponding to consecutive ionisation
  stages in star-forming regions.  Methods: We compiled observational data from a
  sample of star-forming galaxies (SFGs), including luminous and ultraluminous infrared
  galaxies (LIRGs and ULIRGs), to study the ensuremathη$_IR$$^′$ and its equivalent
  expression in two dimensions, the softness diagram. We compared them with predictions
  from photoionisation models to determine the shape of the ionising continuum energy
  distribution in each case. We also used the measured emission-line ratios as input
  for HCMISTRY-TEFF-IR, a code that performs a Bayesian-like comparison with photoionisation
  model predictions in order to quantify the equivalent effective temperature (T$_*$)
  and the ionisation parameter.  Results: We found similar average values within the
  errors of ensuremathη$_IR$$^′$ in (U)LIRGs (ensuremath-0.57) in the rest of the
  SFGs (ensuremath-0.51), which could be interpreted as indicative of a similar incident
  radiation field. This result is confirmed from the analysis using HCM-TEFF-IR, which
  simultaneously points to a slightly lower, although similar within the errors, T$_*$
  scale for (U)LIRGs, even when a higher dust-to-gas mass ratio is considered in the
  models for these objects. These derived T$_*$ values are compatible with the ionisation
  from massive stars, without any need of harder ionising sources, both for (U)LIRGs
  and the rest of the SFGs. However, the derived T$_*$ in (U)LIRGs do not show any
  correlation with metallicity. This could be interpreted as a sign that their similar
  average T$_*$ values are due to the attenuation of the energetic incident flux from
  massive stars by the heated dust mixed with the gas. This is supported by the known
  very large amounts of small grains associated with the very high star formation
  rates measured in galaxies of this type.'
