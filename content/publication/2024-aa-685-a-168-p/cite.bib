 abstract = {Context. The infrared (IR) range is extremely useful in the context of
chemical abundance studies of the gas-phase interstellar medium
(ISM) due to the large variety of ionic species traced in this
regime, the negligible effects from dust attenuation or
temperature stratification, and the amount of data that has been
and will be released in the coming years. \ Aims:
Taking advantage of available IR emission lines, we analysed the
chemical content of the gas-phase ISM in a sample of 131 star-
forming galaxies (SFGs) and 73 active galactic nuclei (AGNs). In
particular, we derived the chemical content via their total
oxygen abundance in combination with nitrogen and sulphur
abundances, and with the ionisation parameter. \
Methods: We used a new version of the code HII-CHI-MISTRY-IR
v3.1, which allowed us to estimate log(N/O), 12+log(O/H), log(U)
and, for the first time, 12+log(S/H) from IR emission lines,
which can be applied to both SFGs and AGNs. We tested whether
the estimates from this new version, which only considers
sulphur lines for the derivation of sulphur abundances, are
compatible with previous studies. \ Results: While
most of the SFGs and AGNs show solar log(N/O) abundances, we
find a large spread in the log(S/O) relative abundances.
Specifically, we find extremely low log(S/O) values (1/10 solar)
in some SFGs and AGNs with solar-like oxygen abundances. This
result warns against the use of optical and IR sulphur emission
lines to estimate oxygen abundances when no prior estimation of
log(S/O) is provided. \\Full Tables
