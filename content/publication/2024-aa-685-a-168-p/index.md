abstract: "Context. The infrared (IR) range is extremely useful in the context of
  chemical abundance studies of the gas-phase interstellar medium (ISM) due to the
  large variety of ionic species traced in this regime, the negligible effects from
  dust attenuation or temperature stratification, and the amount of data that has
  been and will be released in the coming years.  Aims: Taking advantage of available
  IR emission lines, we analysed the chemical content of the gas-phase ISM in a sample
  of 131 star- forming galaxies (SFGs) and 73 active galactic nuclei (AGNs). In particular,
  we derived the chemical content via their total oxygen abundance in combination
  with nitrogen and sulphur abundances, and with the ionisation parameter.  Methods:
  We used a new version of the code HII-CHI-MISTRY-IR v3.1, which allowed us to estimate
  log(N/O), 12+log(O/H), log(U) and, for the first time, 12+log(S/H) from IR emission
  lines, which can be applied to both SFGs and AGNs. We tested whether the estimates
  from this new version, which only considers sulphur lines for the derivation of
  sulphur abundances, are compatible with previous studies.  Results: While most of
  the SFGs and AGNs show solar log(N/O) abundances, we find a large spread in the
  log(S/O) relative abundances. Specifically, we find extremely low log(S/O) values
  (1/10 solar) in some SFGs and AGNs with solar-like oxygen abundances. This result
  warns against the use of optical and IR sulphur emission lines to estimate oxygen
  abundances when no prior estimation of log(S/O) is provided."
