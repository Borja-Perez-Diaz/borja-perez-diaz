abstract: Green Pea galaxies (GPs) present among the most intense starbursts known
  in the nearby Universe. These galaxies are regarded as local analogs of high-redshift
  galaxies, making them a benchmark in the understanding of the star formation processes
  and the galactic evolution in the early Universe. In this work, we performed an
  integral field spectroscopic (IFS) study for a set of 24 GPs to investigate the
  interplay between its ionized interstellar medium (ISM) and the massive star formation
  that these galaxies present. Observations were taken in the optical spectral range
  (ensuremathłambda4750 ̊A-ensuremathłambda9350 Å) with the MUSE spectrograph attached
  to the 8.2 m telescope VLT. Spatial extension criteria were employed to verify which
  GPs are spatially resolved in the MUSE data cubes. We created and analyzed maps
  of spatially distributed emission lines (at different stages of excitation), continuum
  emission, and properties of the ionized ISM (e.g., ionization structure indicators,
  physical-chemical conditions, dust extinction). We also took advantage of our IFS
  data to produce integrated spectra of selected galactic regions in order to study
  their physical-chemical conditions. Maps of relevant emission lines and emission
  line ratios show that higher-excitation gas is preferentially located in the center
  of the galaxy, where the starburst is present. The continuum maps, with an average
  angular extent of 4″, exhibit more complex structures than the emission line maps.
  However, the [O III]ensuremathłambda5007 r̊ emission line maps tend to extend beyond
  the continuum images (the average angular extent is 5.5″), indicating the presence
  of low surface brightness ionized gas in the outer parts of the galaxies. Hensuremathα/Hensuremathβ,
  [S II]/Hensuremathα, and [O I]/Hensuremathα maps trace low-extinction, optically
  thin regions. The line ratios [O III]/Hensuremathβ and [N II]/Hensuremathα span
  extensive ranges, with values varying from 0.5 dex to 0.9 dex and from ensuremath-1.7
  dex to ensuremath-0.8 dex, respectively. Regarding the integrated spectra, the line
  ratios were fit to derive physical properties including the electron densities n$_e$
  = 30 ensuremath- 530 cm$^ensuremath-3$, and, in six GPs with a measurable [O III]ensuremathłambda4363
  r̊ line, electron temperatures of T$_e$ = 11 500 K-15 500 K, so the direct method
  was applied in these objects to retrieve metallicities 12 + log(O/H)≃8. We found
  the presence of the high-ionizing nebular He IIensuremathłambda4686 rA ̊line in
  three GPs, where two of them present among the highest sSFR values (> 8 × 10$^8$
  yr$^ensuremath-1$) in this sample. Non-Wolf-Rayet (WR) features are detected in
  these galaxy spectra.
