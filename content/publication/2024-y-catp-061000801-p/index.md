abstract: 'In this study, we determine the chemical abundances of the ISM in a sample
  of 77 (U)LIRGs dominated by star-formation activity; as a control sample, we also
  determine the abundances in 55 HII extragalactic regions and star-forming dwarf
  galaxies. Thus, a total sample of 132 galaxies is analysed with IR observations.
  We use spectroscopic observations of nebular emission lines in the near-, mid- and
  far-IR ranges acquired with Spitzer-IRS, Herschel-PACS and Akari for measurements
  of the BrensuremathÎ± emission. Table1: List of IR emission line fluxes, other IR
  observables and characteristics of host galaxies from Fernandez-Ontiveros et al.
  (2021A&A...652A..23F, Cat. J/A+A/652/A23). Table2: List of IR emission line fluxes,
  other IR observables and characteristics of host galaxies from IDEOS. Table3: Chemical
  abundances derived from HII-CHI_Mistry-IR for the sample taken from Fernandez- Ontiveros
  et al. (2021A&A...652A..23F, Cat. J/A+A/652/A23). Table4: Chemical abundances derived
  from HII-CHI_Mistry-IR for the (U)LIRG sample from IDEOS. (4 data files).'
