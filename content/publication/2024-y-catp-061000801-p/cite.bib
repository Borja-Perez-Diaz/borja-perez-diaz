 abstract = {In this study, we determine the chemical abundances of the ISM in a
sample of 77 (U)LIRGs dominated by star-formation activity; as a
control sample, we also determine the abundances in 55 HII
extragalactic regions and star-forming dwarf galaxies. Thus, a
total sample of 132 galaxies is analysed with IR observations.
We use spectroscopic observations of nebular emission lines in
the near-, mid- and far-IR ranges acquired with Spitzer-IRS,
Herschel-PACS and Akari for measurements of the
Br\ensuremathÎ± emission.
