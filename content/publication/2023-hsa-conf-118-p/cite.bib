 abstract = {Future and on-going infrared and radio observatories such as JWST, METIS
or ALMA will increase the amount of rest-frame IR spectroscopic
data for galaxies by several orders of magnitude. While studies
of the chemical composition of the ISM based on optical
observations have been widely spread over decades for Star-
forming Galaxies (SFG) and, more recently, for Active Galactic
Nuclei (AGN), similar studies need to be performed using IR
data. This regime can be especially useful in the case of AGN
given that it is less affected by temperature and dust
extinction, traces higher ionic species and can also provide
robust estimations of the chemical abundance ratio N/O. We
present a new tool based on a bayesian-like methodology (HII-
CHI-Mistry-IR) to estimate chemical abundances from IR emission
lines in AGN. We use a sample of 58 AGN with IR spectroscopic
data retrieved from the literature, composed of 43 Seyferts, 8
ULIRGs, 4 LIRGs and 3 LINERs, to probe the validity of our
method. The estimations of the chemical abundances based on IR
lines in our sample are later compared with the corresponding
abundances derived from the optical emission lines in the same
objects. This tool takes advantage of photoionization models,
characterized by the chemical abundance ratios O/H and N/O and
the ionization parameter U, to compare their predicted emission-
line fluxes with a set of observed values. We report mainly
solar and also subsolar abundances for O/H in the nuclear region
for our sample of AGN, whereas N/O clusters around solar values.
We find a discrepancy between the chemical abundances derived
from IR and optical emission lines. This discrepancy, also
reported by previous studies of the composition of the ISM in
AGN from IR observations, is independent from the gas density or
the incident radiation field to the gas, and it is likely
associated with dust obscuration and/or temperature
stratification within the gas nebula.},
