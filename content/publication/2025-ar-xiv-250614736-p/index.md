abstract: The derivation of sulphur chemical abundances in the gas-phase of star-
  forming galaxies is explored in this work, using the emission lines produced in
  these regions in the optical part of the spectrum and by means of photoionization
  models. We adapted the code HII-CHI-mistry to account for these abundances by implementing
  additional grids of models that assume a variable sulphur-to-oxygen abundance ratio,
  beyond the commonly assumed solar ratio. The addition of these models, and their
  use in a new iteration of the code allows us to use sulphur lines to precisely estimate
  the sulphur abundance, even in the absence of auroral lines. This approach aligns
  with the results from the direct method, and no additional assumptions about the
  ionization correction factor are needed, as the models directly predict the total
  sulphur abundance. We applied this new methodology to a large sample of star-forming
  regions from the MaNGA survey, and we explored the variation of the S/O ratio as
  a function of metallicity, making corrections for the significant contribution from
  diffuse ionized gas, which particularly affects the [SII] emission. Our results
  indicate no significant deviations from the solar S/O value in the range 8.0 < 12+log(O/H)
  < 8.7, where the bulk of the MaNGA sample stays, , but also with possible enhancements
  of sulphur production both at low and high metallicity regimes. The latter may be
  linked to the depletion of oxygen in the gas-phase due to its incorporation onto
  dust grains
