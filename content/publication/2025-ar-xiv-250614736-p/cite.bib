 abstract = {The derivation of sulphur chemical abundances in the gas-phase of star-
forming galaxies is explored in this work, using the emission
lines produced in these regions in the optical part of the
spectrum and by means of photoionization models. We adapted the
code HII-CHI-mistry to account for these abundances by
implementing additional grids of models that assume a variable
sulphur-to-oxygen abundance ratio, beyond the commonly assumed
solar ratio. The addition of these models, and their use in a
new iteration of the code allows us to use sulphur lines to
precisely estimate the sulphur abundance, even in the absence of
auroral lines. This approach aligns with the results from the
direct method, and no additional assumptions about the
ionization correction factor are needed, as the models directly
predict the total sulphur abundance. We applied this new
methodology to a large sample of star-forming regions from the
MaNGA survey, and we explored the variation of the S/O ratio as
a function of metallicity, making corrections for the
significant contribution from diffuse ionized gas, which
particularly affects the [SII] emission. Our results indicate no
significant deviations from the solar S/O value in the range 8.0
< 12+log(O/H) < 8.7, where the bulk of the MaNGA sample stays, ,
but also with possible enhancements of sulphur production both
at low and high metallicity regimes. The latter may be linked to
the depletion of oxygen in the gas-phase due to its
incorporation onto dust grains},
