 abstract = {We present an adapted version of the code HII-CHI-MISTRY-UV to derive
chemical abundances from emission lines in the ultraviolet, for
use in narrow line regions (NLR) of active galactic nuclei
(AGN). We evaluate different ultraviolet emission line ratios
and how different assumptions about the models, including the
presence of dust grains, the shape of the incident spectral
energy distribution, or the thickness of the gas envelope around
the central source, may affect the final estimates as a function
of the set of emission lines used. We compare our results with
other published recipes for deriving abundances using the same
emission lines and show that deriving the carbon-to-oxygen
abundance ratio using C III] \ensuremathłambda 1909 ̊A
and O III] \ensuremathłambda 1665 \Å emission lines is
a robust indicator of the metal content in AGN that is nearly
independent of the model assumptions, similar to the case of
star-forming regions. Moreover, we show that a prior
determination of C/O allows for a much more precise
determination of the total oxygen abundance using carbon UV
lines, as opposed to assuming an arbitrary relationship between
O/H and C/O, which can lead to non-negligible discrepancies.},
