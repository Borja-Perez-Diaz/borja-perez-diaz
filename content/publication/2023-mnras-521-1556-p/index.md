abstract: We present an adapted version of the code HII-CHI-MISTRY-UV to derive chemical
  abundances from emission lines in the ultraviolet, for use in narrow line regions
  (NLR) of active galactic nuclei (AGN). We evaluate different ultraviolet emission
  line ratios and how different assumptions about the models, including the presence
  of dust grains, the shape of the incident spectral energy distribution, or the thickness
  of the gas envelope around the central source, may affect the final estimates as
  a function of the set of emission lines used. We compare our results with other
  published recipes for deriving abundances using the same emission lines and show
  that deriving the carbon-to-oxygen abundance ratio using C III] ensuremathłambda
  1909 ̊A and O III] ensuremathłambda 1665 Å emission lines is a robust indicator
  of the metal content in AGN that is nearly independent of the model assumptions,
  similar to the case of star-forming regions. Moreover, we show that a prior determination
  of C/O allows for a much more precise determination of the total oxygen abundance
  using carbon UV lines, as opposed to assuming an arbitrary relationship between
  O/H and C/O, which can lead to non-negligible discrepancies.
