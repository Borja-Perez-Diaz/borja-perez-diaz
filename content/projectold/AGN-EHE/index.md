The aim of this collaboration is to bring together four groups of researchers with proved expertises and skills and with important national and international collaborations in different areas of the AGN phenomenon - covering a large range of intrinsic luminosities (from LINERs to QSOs), low to high accretion rates, distances close to the BH to galactic and cluster scales, low to high redshift - and from the perspective of both statistical and/or detailed analysis of observational data and numerical simulations. The topics we plan to address include how SMBHs grow, the connection between BH low and high accretion systems, the role played by obscuration in AGNs, and the study of star formation and nuclear activity in lenticular galaxies, and AGN feeding and feedback. The final goal is consolidating a scientifically strong group to address the challenges in the research frontier of AGNs and their connection with galaxy formation and evolution, where we expect to go on making significant contributions.
