     abstract = "{The derivation of sulphur chemical abundances in the gas-phase of star-
        forming galaxies is explored in this work, using the emission
        lines produced in these regions in the optical part of the
        spectrum and by means of photoionization models. We adapted the
        code HII-CHI-mistry to account for these abundances by
        implementing additional grids of models that assume a variable
        sulphur-to-oxygen abundance ratio, beyond the commonly assumed
        solar ratio. The addition of these models, and their use in a
        new iteration of the code allows us to use sulphur lines to
        precisely estimate the sulphur abundance, even in the absence of
        auroral lines. This approach aligns with the results from the
        direct method, and no additional assumptions about the
        ionization correction factor are needed, as the models directly
        predict the total sulphur abundance. We applied this new
        methodology to a large sample of star-forming regions from the
        MaNGA survey, and we explored the variation of the S/O ratio as
        a function of metallicity, making corrections for the
        significant contribution from diffuse ionized gas, which
        particularly affects the [SII] emission. Our results indicate no
        significant deviations from the solar S/O value in the range 8.0
        < 12+log(O/H) < 8.7, where the bulk of the MaNGA sample stays, ,
        but also with possible enhancements of sulphur production both
        at low and high metallicity regimes. The latter may be linked to
        the depletion of oxygen in the gas-phase due to its
        incorporation onto dust grains}",

        spectroscopic data for galaxies by several orders of magnitude.
        The studies of the chemical composition of the interstellar
        medium (ISM) can be hugely improved exploiting the data obtained
        in these spectral ranges. Among the advantages of the IR regime,
        it is less affected by temperature and dust extinction, traces
        higher ionic species, and can also provide robust estimations of
        the chemical abundance ratio N/O. For instance, in
        (Ultra)-Luminous Infrared Galaxies ([U]LIRGs), the IR regime
        peers through their dusty medium and allows us to include the
        obscured metals in their studies. In this contribution, we
        describe how to take advantage of the bayesian-like code HII-
        CHI-Mistry-IR to analyze the chemical content in a sample of
        ULIRGs, reviewing our findings from the study of their IR
        emission, comparing them to the results from optical data, and
        ending up by describing the finding of deviations in a sub-
        sample of the analyzed ULIRGs from their expected mass-
        metallicity relation (MZR). We interpret this result as a
        consequence of the action of massive inflows of metal poor gas
        that produces that some galaxies experience a ``deep-diving''

        excitation lines in the same spectral regime to explore its
        potential use for studying the narrow-line regions of active
        galactic nuclei (AGNs). Methods. We adapted the IR softness
        diagram to consider very high-excitation lines, such as [Ne
        V]14.3, 24.3 {\ensuremath{\mu}}m or [O IV]25.9
        {\ensuremath{\mu}}m. The measured emission-line ratios were
        included as inputs for the code HCM-TEFF-IR in order to provide
        a quantification for the ionization and the
        {\ensuremath{\alpha}}$_{OX}$. The latter is sensitive to the
        spectral shape of the incident continuum in AGNs. We applied
        this code to a large AGN sample that included different spectral
        types with available Spitzer/IRS, Herschel/PACS, and/or
        SOFIA/FIFI-LS mid-IR spectroscopic observations. Results. The

        III]52, 88 {\ensuremath{\mu}}m/[O IV]25.9 {\ensuremath{\mu}}m
        emission line ratios is a robust proxy for the shape of the
        ionizing continuum in AGNs. Given the difficulties to observe
        the [O III]52, 88 {\ensuremath{\mu}}m lines, an alternative
        based on the [S III]18.7 {\ensuremath{\mu}}m+[S IV]10.5
        {\ensuremath{\mu}}m lines can be used. The inclusion of very
        high-excitation lines in the input ratios for HCM-TEFF-IR to
        derive both {\ensuremath{\alpha}}$_{OX}$ and U for the studied
        sample points to a bimodal distribution of galaxies. One of the
        peaks is characterized by relatively harder values of
        {\ensuremath{\alpha}}$_{OX}$ around ‑1.4 in combination with low
        values for log U around ‑2.4, while the other peak shows a
        softer {\ensuremath{\alpha}}$_{OX}$ {\ensuremath{\sim}} ‑1.7 and
        high values of log U {\ensuremath{\sim}} ‑1.5. This result is
        consistent with the existence of two very distinct AGN
        populations, where one has a softer ionizing continuum, possibly
        dominated by a radiatively efficient accretion disk in bright
        Seyfert nuclei. In contrast, we observed a harder radiation

        nature of their ionizing source is uncertain, although they are
        the most abundant type of active galaxies in the nearby
        Universe. Aims. Considering different scenarios for the ionizing
        source (hot old stellar populations, active galactic nuclei, or
        inefficient accretion disks), we analyze the implications of
        these assumptions to constrain the chemical content of the gas-
        phase interstellar medium. Methods. We used a sample of 105
        galaxies from the survey called Mapping Nearby Galaxies at
        Apache Point Observatory (MaNGA), whose nuclear central spaxels
        show LINER-like emission. For each scenario we considered, we
        built a grid of photoionization models (4928 models for each
        considered ionizing source) that were later used in the open-
        source code HII-CHI-MISTRY. This allowed us to estimate chemical
        abundance ratios such as 12+log(O/H) or log(N/O) and to
        constrain the ionization parameters that characterize the
        ionized interstellar medium in these galaxies. Results. The
        oxygen abundances in the nuclear region of LINER-like galaxies
        are spread over a wide range 8.08 < 12+log(O/H) < 8.89, with a
        median solar value (in agreement with previous studies) when
        models for active galactic nuclei are considered. Nevertheless,
        the nitrogen-to-oxygen ratio we derived is much less affected by
        the assumptions on the ionizing source and indicates suprasolar
        values (log(N/O) = ‑0.69). By comparing the different scenarios,
        we show that if hot old stellar populations caused the
        ionization of the interstellar medium, a complex picture (e.g.,
        outflows and/or inflows that scale with the galaxy chemical
        abundance) would be needed to explain the chemical enrichment
        history, whereas the assumption of active galactic nucleus
        activity is compatible with the standard scenario that is found
        in most galaxies.}",

     abstract = "{A large, faint nebula was unexpectedly discovered near M31 using
        narrowband [O III] images. Its apparent size and the lack of a
        clear counterpart at other wavelengths make it unique and
        challenging to explain. We aim to determine whether the nebula
        is extragalactic or located within the Milky Way. This will
        enable us to constrain its physical properties and assess its
        nature. To do so, we obtained deep narrowband [O II]3727 and
        H$\alpha$+[NII] observations with the JAST80 telescope at the
        Observatorio Astrof{\'\i}sico de Javalambre, as well as high-
        spectral-resolution spectroscopy at four locations within the
        region of interest using MEGARA at the Gran Telescopio Canarias.
        We found extended [O II] emission along two near-parallel
        strands to the [O III], offset by six arcmin. The nebular
        spectra reveals up to 6 emission lines from [O III]4959,5007,
        H$\beta$, [N II]6583, and [S II]6716,6731. Their receding
        velocities are above $-$40 km s$^{-1}$, far from the systemic
        velocity of M31 ($-$300 km s$^{-1}$). The fluxes and velocities
        are consistent for the same lines across different regions of
        the nebula. The nebular properties suggest a location within the
        Milky Way rather than being physically associated with M31. The
        most likely scenario is a resolved ionization structure in a
        Galactic nebula with a separation between [O II] and [O III] of
        a few parsecs. The observed receding velocities would be
        unprecedented for an object physically linked to M31 but are
        common for nearby gas filaments. Their consistency across the
        nebula would also be unusual if it were larger than a
        kiloparsec. The analysis of the emission-line ratios, line
        widths, and morphology suggests the possibility of it being an
        interstellar gas filament with an additional source of
        ionization to explain the [O III] emission. However, the complex
        properties of this object call for further observations to
        confirm its nature.}",

        regime, the negligible effects from dust attenuation or
        temperature stratification, and the amount of data that has been
        and will be released in the coming years. \textbackslash Aims:
        Taking advantage of available IR emission lines, we analysed the
        chemical content of the gas-phase ISM in a sample of 131 star-
        forming galaxies (SFGs) and 73 active galactic nuclei (AGNs). In
        particular, we derived the chemical content via their total
        oxygen abundance in combination with nitrogen and sulphur
        abundances, and with the ionisation parameter. \textbackslash
        Methods: We used a new version of the code HII-CHI-MISTRY-IR
        v3.1, which allowed us to estimate log(N/O), 12+log(O/H), log(U)
        and, for the first time, 12+log(S/H) from IR emission lines,
        which can be applied to both SFGs and AGNs. We tested whether
        the estimates from this new version, which only considers
        sulphur lines for the derivation of sulphur abundances, are
        compatible with previous studies. \textbackslash Results: While
        most of the SFGs and AGNs show solar log(N/O) abundances, we
        find a large spread in the log(S/O) relative abundances.
        Specifically, we find extremely low log(S/O) values (1/10 solar)
        in some SFGs and AGNs with solar-like oxygen abundances. This
        result warns against the use of optical and IR sulphur emission
        lines to estimate oxygen abundances when no prior estimation of
        log(S/O) is provided. \textbackslash\textbackslashFull Tables

        supernovae (PISN) in chemical modelling is included, through
        which a similar behaviour of the Fe/O ratios was reproduced
        successfully. \textbackslash Methods: We used chemical evolution
        models that considered the stages of PISN in the previously
        published yields and adopted a suitable initial mass function
        (IMF) to characterize this evolutionary stage appropriately.
        \textbackslash Results: The peculiarly high values and the
        behaviour of the observed S/O versus O/H relation can be
        reproduced when the ejecta of very massive stars that go through
        the process of PISN are taken into account. Additionally, a
        bimodal top-heavy IMF and an initial strong burst of star
        formation are required to reach the reported high S/O values.
        \textbackslash Conclusions: We show that the role of very
        massive stars going through the process of PISN should be taken
        into account to explain the chemical enrichment of sulphur and
        oxygen in metal-poor star-forming regions.}",

        from the combination of mid-infrared wavelength range
        transitions corresponding to consecutive ionisation stages in

        observational data from a sample of star-forming galaxies
        (SFGs), including luminous and ultraluminous infrared galaxies
        (LIRGs and ULIRGs), to study the
        {\ensuremath{\eta}}$_{IR}$$^{'}$ and its equivalent expression
        in two dimensions, the softness diagram. We compared them with
        predictions from photoionisation models to determine the shape
        of the ionising continuum energy distribution in each case. We
        also used the measured emission-line ratios as input for
        HCMISTRY-TEFF-IR, a code that performs a Bayesian-like
        comparison with photoionisation model predictions in order to
        quantify the equivalent effective temperature (T$_{*}$) and the

        average values within the errors of
        {\ensuremath{\eta}}$_{IR}$$^{'}$ in (U)LIRGs
        ({\ensuremath{-}}0.57) in the rest of the SFGs
        ({\ensuremath{-}}0.51), which could be interpreted as indicative
        of a similar incident radiation field. This result is confirmed
        from the analysis using HCM-TEFF-IR, which simultaneously points
        to a slightly lower, although similar within the errors, T$_{*}$
        scale for (U)LIRGs, even when a higher dust-to-gas mass ratio is
        considered in the models for these objects. These derived
        T$_{*}$ values are compatible with the ionisation from massive
        stars, without any need of harder ionising sources, both for
        (U)LIRGs and the rest of the SFGs. However, the derived T$_{*}$
        in (U)LIRGs do not show any correlation with metallicity. This
        could be interpreted as a sign that their similar average
        T$_{*}$ values are due to the attenuation of the energetic
        incident flux from massive stars by the heated dust mixed with
        the gas. This is supported by the known very large amounts of
        small grains associated with the very high star formation rates
        measured in galaxies of this type.}",

        processes in the formation and evolution of galaxies. However,
        the key elements that govern them, such as gas accretion and
        outflow, are not fully understood. This is especially true for
        luminous and massive galaxies, which usually suffer strong
        feedback as massive outflows and large-scale gas accretion
        triggered by galaxy interactions. Using a sample of 77 luminous
        infrared (IR) galaxies, we derive chemical abundances using new
        diagnostics based on nebular IR lines, which peer through their
        dusty medium and allow us to include the obscured metals. In
        contrast to optically based studies, our analysis reveals that
        most luminous IR galaxies remain close to the mass-metallicity
        relation. Four galaxies with extreme star formation rates (>60
        M$_{{\ensuremath{\odot}}}$ yr$^{{\ensuremath{-}}1}$) in their
        late-merger stages show strongly depressed metallicities (12 +
        log(O/H) {\ensuremath{\approx}} 7.7-8.1) along with solar-like
        N/O ratios, indicative of gas mixing processes and suggesting
        the action of massive infall of metal-poor gas in a short phase,
        eventually followed by rapid enrichment. These results challenge
        the classical gas equilibrium scenario applied to main-sequence
        galaxies, suggesting that chemical enrichment and stellar-mass
        growth in luminous IR galaxies likely occur via mergers, driving
        these galaxies out of chemical equilibrium.}",

     abstract = "{Green Pea galaxies (GPs) present among the most intense starbursts known
        in the nearby Universe. These galaxies are regarded as local
        analogs of high-redshift galaxies, making them a benchmark in
        the understanding of the star formation processes and the
        galactic evolution in the early Universe. In this work, we
        performed an integral field spectroscopic (IFS) study for a set
        of 24 GPs to investigate the interplay between its ionized
        interstellar medium (ISM) and the massive star formation that
        these galaxies present. Observations were taken in the optical
        spectral range ({\ensuremath{\lambda}}4750
        {\r{A}}-{\ensuremath{\lambda}}9350 {\r{A}}) with the MUSE
        spectrograph attached to the 8.2 m telescope VLT. Spatial
        extension criteria were employed to verify which GPs are
        spatially resolved in the MUSE data cubes. We created and
        analyzed maps of spatially distributed emission lines (at
        different stages of excitation), continuum emission, and
        properties of the ionized ISM (e.g., ionization structure
        indicators, physical-chemical conditions, dust extinction). We
        also took advantage of our IFS data to produce integrated
        spectra of selected galactic regions in order to study their
        physical-chemical conditions. Maps of relevant emission lines
        and emission line ratios show that higher-excitation gas is
        preferentially located in the center of the galaxy, where the
        starburst is present. The continuum maps, with an average
        angular extent of 4″, exhibit more complex structures than the
        emission line maps. However, the [O
        III]{\ensuremath{\lambda}}5007 {\r{A}} emission line maps tend
        to extend beyond the continuum images (the average angular
        extent is 5.5″), indicating the presence of low surface

        ratios [O III]/H{\ensuremath{\beta}} and [N
        II]/H{\ensuremath{\alpha}} span extensive ranges, with values
        varying from 0.5 dex to 0.9 dex and from {\ensuremath{-}}1.7 dex
        to {\ensuremath{-}}0.8 dex, respectively. Regarding the
        integrated spectra, the line ratios were fit to derive physical

        or ALMA will increase the amount of rest-frame IR spectroscopic
        data for galaxies by several orders of magnitude. While studies
        of the chemical composition of the ISM based on optical
        observations have been widely spread over decades for Star-
        forming Galaxies (SFG) and, more recently, for Active Galactic
        Nuclei (AGN), similar studies need to be performed using IR
        data. This regime can be especially useful in the case of AGN
        given that it is less affected by temperature and dust
        extinction, traces higher ionic species and can also provide
        robust estimations of the chemical abundance ratio N/O. We
        present a new tool based on a bayesian-like methodology (HII-
        CHI-Mistry-IR) to estimate chemical abundances from IR emission
        lines in AGN. We use a sample of 58 AGN with IR spectroscopic
        data retrieved from the literature, composed of 43 Seyferts, 8
        ULIRGs, 4 LIRGs and 3 LINERs, to probe the validity of our
        method. The estimations of the chemical abundances based on IR
        lines in our sample are later compared with the corresponding
        abundances derived from the optical emission lines in the same
        objects. This tool takes advantage of photoionization models,
        characterized by the chemical abundance ratios O/H and N/O and
        the ionization parameter U, to compare their predicted emission-
        line fluxes with a set of observed values. We report mainly
        solar and also subsolar abundances for O/H in the nuclear region
        for our sample of AGN, whereas N/O clusters around solar values.
        We find a discrepancy between the chemical abundances derived
        from IR and optical emission lines. This discrepancy, also
        reported by previous studies of the composition of the ISM in
        AGN from IR observations, is independent from the gas density or
        the incident radiation field to the gas, and it is likely
        associated with dust obscuration and/or temperature
        stratification within the gas nebula.}",

        JWST, METIS, and ALMA will increase the amount of rest-frame IR
        spectroscopic data for galaxies by several orders of magnitude.
        While studies of the chemical composition of the interstellar
        medium (ISM) based on optical observations have been widely
        spread over decades for star-forming galaxies (SFGs) and, more
        recently, for active galactic nuclei (AGN), similar studies need
        to be performed using IR data. In the case of AGN, this regime
        can be especially useful given that it is less affected by
        temperature and dust extinction, traces higher ionic species,
        and can also provide robust estimations of the chemical
        abundance ratio N/O. \textbackslash Aims: We present a new tool
        based on a Bayesian-like methodology (HII-CHI-MISTRY-IR) to
        estimate chemical abundances from IR emission lines in AGN. We
        use a sample of 58 AGN with IR spectroscopic data retrieved from
        the literature, composed by 43 Seyferts, eight ultraluminous
        infrared galaxies (ULIRGs), four luminous infrared galaxies
        (LIRGs), and three low-ionization nuclear emission line regions
        (LINERs), to probe the validity of our method. The estimations
        of the chemical abundances based on IR lines in our sample are
        later compared with the corresponding abundances derived from
        the optical emission lines in the same objects. \textbackslash
        Methods: HII-CHI-MISTRY-IR takes advantage of photoionization
        models, characterized by the chemical abundance ratios O/H and
        N/O, and the ionization parameter U, to compare their predicted
        emission-line fluxes with a set of observed values. Instead of
        matching single emission lines, the code uses some specific
        emission-line ratios that are sensitive to the above free
        parameters. \textbackslash Results: We report mainly solar and
        also subsolar abundances for O/H in the nuclear region for our
        sample of AGN, whereas N/O clusters are around solar values. We
        find a discrepancy between the chemical abundances derived from
        IR and optical emission lines, the latter being higher than the
        former. This discrepancy, also reported by previous studies of
        the composition of the ISM in AGN from IR observations, is
        independent of the gas density or the incident radiation field
        to the gas, and it is likely associated with dust obscuration
        and/or temperature stratification within the gas nebula.

        models that cover a wide range in O/H and N/O, and ionisation
        parameter, HII-CHI-MISTRY-IR (HCm-IR) provides abundances based
        on extinction-free and temperature-insensitive tracers, two
        significant advantages over optical diagnostics when these are
        applied to dust obscured regions or unresolved (stratified)
        nebulae. The code performance is probed using three different
        galaxy samples covering a wide range in metallicity, 7.2 < 12 +
        log(O/H) < 8.9, with available IR spectroscopy from Spitzer,
        Herschel and SOFIA, including: 28 low-metallicity dwarf
        galaxies, 19 nearby starbursts, and 9 luminous IR galaxies. The
        IR-based abundances are robust even when the hydrogen
        recombination lines, typically faint in this range, are not
        available. When compared to various optical-based methods, HCm-
        IR is consistent within an average difference of 0.1 dex and a
        scatter of 0.2 dex. Additionally, HCm-IR provides an independent
        N/O measurement when [OIII]52,88{\textmu}m and
        [NIII]57{\textmu}m are measured, probing the secondary
        production of nitrogen. We find systematically lower N/O IR
        abundances when compared to the optical determinations,
        suggesting that IR lines may trace higher excitation gas located
        closer to massive stars. Finally, we applied the code to a
        sample of 8 distant galaxies located at 1.8 < z < 7.5 with
        ground-based detections of the far-IR lines redshifted in the
        submm range, revealing sub-solar N/O and O/H abundances. The

        find systematically lower N/O IR abundances when compared to the

        IR lines (O<SUP>2+</SUP>, N<SUP>2+</SUP> regions), (ii)
        contamination of diffuse ionized gas affecting the optical lines

        affecting the optical-based determinations. However, we have not

        extinction. We speculatively suggest that the accretion of
        metal-poor gas from the circumgalactic medium could provide an
        explanation for this difference because the rapid decrease of
        total abundances during infall is followed by a N/O ratio
        decrease due to the primary production of young-possibly
        embedded-massive stars, which are preferentially traced by the
        IR diagnostics, while optical diagnostics would better trace the
        secondary production, when both N/O and O/H abundance ratios
